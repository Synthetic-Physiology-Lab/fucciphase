# Examples

1. `extract_calibration_data.ipynb`:
   Example of obtaining a reference curve from a TrackMate file.
   **Note**: We do not provide the TrackMate XML files here.
   Instead, a reference curve is provided,
   which is used in the other examples.
1. `sensor_calibration.ipynb`: 
   Calibrate sensor based on reference curve.
   The intensity profiles are fit to logistic growth curves
   and the time constants of the accumulation and degradation
   are determined.
