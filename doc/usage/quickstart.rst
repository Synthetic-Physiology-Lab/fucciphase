Quickstart
==========

Fucci phase currently supports loading a
[TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) XML file:

.. code-block:: python

    from fucciphase import process_trackmate
    from fucciphase.sensor import get_fuccisa_default_sensor

    trackmate_xml = "path/to/trackmate.xml"
    channels = ["MEAN_INTENSITY_CH3", "MEAN_INTENSITY_CH4"]

    sensor = get_fuccisa_default_sensor()

    df = process_trackmate(
        trackmate_xml,
        channels=channels,
        sensor=sensor,
        thresholds=[0.1, 0.1],
    )
    print(df["CELL_CYCLE_PERC"])

``process_trackmate`` requires a channel list, a FUCCI sensor object, and
per-channel thresholds.

Required inputs for ``process_trackmate``:

- ``channels``: list of fluorescence column names from the TrackMate table.
- ``sensor``: a FUCCI sensor instance (for example ``get_fuccisa_default_sensor()``).
- ``thresholds``: one value per channel, each strictly between 0 and 1.

Note: ``CELL_CYCLE_PERC_DTW`` is generated by the DTW alignment workflow
(for example via the CLI), not by ``process_trackmate`` alone.
